// Typography Scale & Hierarchy
// Body Text
// Systems leverage a type scale to offer core text sizes — often named simply as text or body — that include small,
//  medium, large, and if you need it, xs, xl, and so on.
//  Most systems need three or so (thus, my comfort with using t-shirt sizes).
//  Start with a few and expand as necessary as component designs – and page compositions in the wild.
